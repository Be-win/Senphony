# ðŸŽ¨ Sensory Sketchpad

**A Musical Drawing Experience for Everyone**

Sensory Sketchpad is an innovative web application that transforms visual art into musical compositions. It's designed to be accessible, educational, and fun for users of all ages and abilities.

## ðŸŒŸ What is Sensory Sketchpad?

Sensory Sketchpad bridges the gap between visual creativity and musical expression. Users draw on a digital canvas, and their strokes are automatically converted into harmonious musical notes using a pentatonic scale. This creates a unique sensory experience where every brushstroke becomes a musical note.

## ðŸŽµ How It Works

### Visual-to-Musical Translation
- **Drawing Input**: Users draw on the canvas using different colors and brush types
- **Color-to-Note Mapping**: Each color corresponds to a specific musical note (C, D, E, G, A, C2)
- **Pentatonic Scale**: All notes are in a harmonious pentatonic scale, ensuring everything sounds musical
- **Real-time Playback**: Users can play back their drawings as musical compositions

### The Musical System
- **Pink (C)**: 261.63 Hz - Base note
- **Green (D)**: 293.66 Hz - Second note
- **Purple (E)**: 329.63 Hz - Third note
- **Orange (G)**: 392.00 Hz - Fifth note
- **Cyan (A)**: 440.00 Hz - Sixth note
- **Yellow (C2)**: 523.25 Hz - Higher octave
